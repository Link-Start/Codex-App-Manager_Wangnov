//! Asset-based UI themes for the official Codex desktop app.
//!
//! Rust port of codex-theme-studio's core: a theme is AI-generated bitmap
//! assets + CSS + a decorative chrome layer, injected into the running Codex
//! renderer over the Chrome DevTools Protocol (loopback only). **No app file
//! is ever modified, unpacked or replaced** — `app.asar` stays untouched and
//! the notarized signature stays valid; turning the theme off restores stock.
//!
//! Module map (1:1 with the studio's Node modules):
//! - [`theme`]  — theme-package loading/validation (`theme.mjs`)
//! - [`payload`] — renderer payload assembly + fingerprint (`payload.mjs`)
//! - [`cdp`]    — CDP client, target discovery and probing (`cdp.mjs`)
//! - [`native`] — `~/.codex/config.toml` appearance sections (`native-theme.mjs`)
//! - [`daemon`] — in-process keeper that re-injects across reloads/new targets
//!
//! The injected renderer runtime (`src/runtime/theme-runtime.js` and
//! `src/runtime/composer-overflow.mjs`) is authored here — this crate is now
//! the single canonical implementation. It encodes hard-won
//! flicker/idempotence/route discipline (see those files' comments) and must
//! be edited here, not in the studio repo. `awesome-codex-skins`'s
//! `studio/src/runtime/theme-runtime.js` and `studio/src/composer-overflow.mjs`
//! are generated, vendored copies pinned to a commit of this crate (see that
//! repo's `studio/RUNTIME_SOURCE.json` and `SPEC.md` §5); the relationship
//! used to run the other way (this was a Rust port of the studio's file) but
//! the studio now syncs *from* here instead.
